# Network Packet Tracer

A simple network packet analyzer built using Flask and `tcpdump`. This tool captures and displays ARP, TCP, and UDP packets from the network in real time.

## Features
- Captures **ARP**, **TCP**, and **UDP** packets.
- Displays captured packets with details like **timestamp, MAC addresses, IP addresses, and packet length**.
- Simple web interface to filter and view packet details.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/astatineRS/Network-packet-tracer.git
cd Network-packet-tracer
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\\Scripts\\activate'
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Packet Capture Script
```bash
sudo ./capture.sh
```

### 5. Start the Flask Server
```bash
python app.py
```

### 6. Access the Web Interface
Open a browser and go to:
```

```

## File Structure
```
ðŸ“‚ Network-packet-tracer
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ data             # Stores captured packets
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ static           # Contains CSS and JavaScript files
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ templates        # HTML templates for web interface
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py             # Flask backend
â”œâ”€â”€ capture.sh         # Script to capture network packets
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt   # Python dependencies

```

## Troubleshooting
- **Permission Issues:** Run `chmod +x capture.sh` before executing it.
- **Flask App Not Running?** Ensure dependencies are installed and the virtual environment is activated.
- **No Packets Captured?** Ensure `tcpdump` is installed and you have root permissions.
